# The following code breaks on hook we have added to `main.rs` and
# observes process loading. It reads the process's name & `.text`
# section address and uses that information to:
#
# 1. Infer what `.elf` file we need to load to get debug symbols for the process
# 2. Load the symbols with correct `.text` offsets so GDB knows the
#    actual location of functions and data
#
# NOTE: This code does not load anything onto the chip. The processes
# are already on flash and Tock takes care of starting them.
